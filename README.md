### Using Custom Players with `playerClass`

By default, this package uses the native `<video>` element for playback.  
However, you can pass a class that implements the `PlayerInterface` to use any custom player you want â€” such as **HLS**, **DASH**, **WebRTC**, and more.

### Example: Using HLS.js

First, install **Hls.js**:

```bash
npm install hls.js
```

Create a custom player class for HLS:

```ts
import Hls from "hls.js";
import { PlayerInterface } from "./PlayerInterface";

export class HlsVideoPlayer implements PlayerInterface {
  private hls: Hls;
  private video: HTMLVideoElement;

  constructor(video: HTMLVideoElement) {
    this.video = video;
    this.hls = new Hls();
    this.hls.attachMedia(video);
  }

  load(src: string) {
    if (Hls.isSupported()) {
      this.hls.loadSource(src);
    } else if (this.video.canPlayType("application/vnd.apple.mpegurl")) {
      this.video.src = src;
    }
  }

  play() {
    this.video.play();
  }

  pause() {
    this.video.pause();
  }

  destroy() {
    this.hls.destroy();
  }
}
```

Now simply pass the class to the playerClass prop:

```ts
<ReactPlayerCC
src="https://test-streams.mux.dev/x36xhzz/x36xhzz.m3u8"
playerClass={HlsVideoPlayer}
/>
```
